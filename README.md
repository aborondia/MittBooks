# MittBooks
## Andrew Borondia

This is a project I made as part of the Software Developer program at the Manitoba Institute of trades and Technology.
This app, made in React.js, allows you to search through a (local storage) book database (json) and add those books to categories in your "book shelf."

You can find the live version on Netlify [here](https://fervent-visvesvaraya-fc46ee.netlify.app/).
